## Inspiration ##
This was a project created for Build18, a hackathon at Carnegie Mellon University. We wanted to create a VR game with a physical element to make the game even more immersive.

## What It Does ##
This is a VR boating game with a moving platform that responds to the movement of the VR controllers. The objective of the game is collect the coins floating around in the water. The person sits on a moving platform we created that is similar to a turntable. When the person turns the boat, the platform will change direction and speed based on the movement of the VR controller. This allows the user to feel like they are really sitting in a boat and riding on the waves.

## How It Works ##
The VR game is built in Unity and it works with the HTC Vive VR controllers and headset. There must be a camera set up on each side of the moving platform in order for the VR to work correctly. The platform has a timing belt connected to a motor and is connected to the game using an Arduino and a circuit. The turntable changes speed and direction based on the movements of the VR controllers.
